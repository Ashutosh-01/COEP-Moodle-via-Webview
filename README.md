# COEP Moodle App
A small utility to access COEP Moodle on mobile

Logging into your Moodle can be a hectic if your password is very tough !(Like me :P)
If you're tired of entering your login-ID and password everytime you want to view moodle, this app is for you !

This app can save username and password of your COEP Moodle account.
You have to login once and after that no need to remember login credentials !!
Directly go to COEP Moodle by automatically logging in from the app!!

Permissions Required : Storage(For downloading content from moodle)

PS: This app was made for learning the webview and github simultaneously. Don't share without permission

Limitations : App cannot detect incorrect login.
(README is still incomplete and will be improvised later)
